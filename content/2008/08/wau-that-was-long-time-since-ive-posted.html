  <p>Wau, that was a long time since I&#39;ve posted here for the last time. However, a lot of things have happened. I&#39;ve moved from Stockholm to Göteborg, switched job and had a few month of in between. Life is full of surprises. Stockholm was supposed to be a temporary stay and out a few months became three years and together with my few months in Göteborg now I am approaching my 4th anniversary in Sweden. I&#39;ve learned a lot living in Sweden not only professionally, but also about the country and the people. In fact it might be worth &quot;zooming&quot; in on some of things I consider as <i id="rfwo">typical Swedish</i> by now. Stay tuned there is more to come. Regarding my new job - check out this <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/Hardy" id="v1c." title="blog">blog</a> to get an idea for what I am working on now. A tip - how to you call: &quot;A state of regulated hypothermia undergone by some animals to conserve energy during the winter?&quot; :)</p>
