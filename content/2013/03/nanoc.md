title: moving from drupal to nanoc
---

Time to move on to the bright (old) new world of static sites. We were not
entirely satisfied with drupal. Not knowing (or wanting to know) the platform
well made us unable to produce the awesome site we want high level bits to be.
In comes nanoc - what you read here is generated by nanoc. The source is all
available at github so you can do pull requests on all our mistakes - or if you
want to join us as coauthor.
