  <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Fredrik wrote earlier today about the &#39;Online community map&#39; and I got somehow inspired. The map reminded me about a little test I took a while ago. Please don&#39;t ask where exactly the connection is, I actually don&#39;t know. Nevertheless, I dug the link out again - <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/tutorials/aspnet/9acd1f3b-7d04-429f-ab59-08031feb6401/are-you-a-programmer-mye.aspx">here</a> it is.<br /><br />It&#39;s a personality test for programmers ;-) Check it out. The test is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-briggs">Myers-Brigss Type Indicator</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say that I am a <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/ISTJext.asp">JSTJ </a>like many other of my programming friends :)<br /><br />--Hardy</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-05-16</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">I am an ENFJ strangely enough. Interesting is that I definitely used to be I(ntrovert) but has turned E(xtrovert) over the years. It is never to late to change.... I wonder if these categories could be used to make decisions when staffing a project group?</div></div></div>
